I am studying Computer Science with an emphasis in Human-Computer Interaction at BYU with a minor in Design Thinking, and I am planning on graduating April 2028. I love UX/UI Design and Development, coding, and creating interactive projects.

### 💻 Projects
#### [DoodleDrop](https://github.com/AudreyBurrell/doodledrop)
**Developed as part of _CS 260 (Web Programming)_ at BYU, January-April 2025.**

DoodleDrop is a web app where users can draw on a digital canvas and save them to their 'gallery'. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript (React)**, **Node.js**, and  **MongoDB**. Includes user authentication, gallery management, and an interactive design. 

#### [StudyingGame](https://github.com/AudreyBurrell/StudyingGame)
**Developed as a personal project, September 2025 - Present**

StudyingGame (name will be changed later) is a mash between Quizlet and Blooket, keeping the best parts of each and (hopefully) getting rid of the parts that make it hard to use those applications. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**. Users can manually create or import question sets (via CSV) and practice using flashcards, tests. At the end of the activities, it will display the percentage of questions they got right and if they got any question wrong more than once, it will display those questions and offer a personalized flashcard activity with just those questions. It uses **Node.js** for user authentication and storing question sets. Planned features includes adding more game-ified ways that the user can study, such as a platformer game. Planned features include saving user sets for later review. 

#### [Cook-a-Book](https://www.figma.com/proto/wEGvZ31apc8JDXqlJtnj7L/COOK-A-Book?node-id=0-1&t=Nn884TdWPmBlZraB-1)
**Developed as a team project as part of _CS 256 (Intro to Human-Computer Interaction)_ at BYU, October 2025 - December 2025**

This application was created using **Figma** and included several rounds of review from potential users, other students in the class, and the professor and TA. We went from paper prototypes to this high-fidelity prototype. We thought of Cook-A-Book when interviewing several of our peers and finding that many people have a hard time with storing all their recipies or finding recipies that they could make. It was also developed as a team project. I designed the Community pages, most of the popups, the settings page, and the meal planning pages. Other features in Cook-A-Book includes a place to add recipies (either from links, images, or manually typing it out) and a popular/community area (where the user can also add those recipies). On each recipe page, some dietary information and information about the recipie itself (cook time, prep time, etc.) are viewable instantly. The user then can organize all their recipies into "Cookbooks".

#### [Semester To-Do List](https://github.com/AudreyBurrell/Semester-to-do-list)
**Developed as a personal project, December 2025 - January 2026**

This is an application where the user can upload a CSV or manually enter in various assignments that they have to do throughout the semester. I thought of this as I was talking to fellow students about how they kept track of assignments, and there was always a few problems that I noticed about each of them (mainly they can become crowded pretty fast, it can be hard to check things off, or color coding is difficult). After getting all the assignments in that the user wants, they can view it in a daily to-do list (here they can also check things off), in a weekly to-do list, and a monthly to do list. Each item is color-coded based off the color that the user chose for the class. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **React** for the front end and **Node.js** for the backend.

#### [Brainstorm-Board](https://github.com/AudreyBurrell/BrainstormBoard)
**Developed as a personal project, January 2026 - Present**

This is basically a virtual whitebaord where the user can draw, select premade templates, add draggable text boxes and sticky notes, and also customize some visual settings like font color and size. They can download a JSON to their computer and then reupload it (and still be able to edit everything after uploading it). If the user is logged in, they also have the ability to save boards to their "library" and continue editing them that way. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **React** for the front end, and **Node.js** for the backend.

#### [Chess](https://github.com/AudreyBurrell/chess)
**Developed as part of _CS 240 (Advanced Software Construction)_ at BYU, January 2026 - Present**

This is an application where the user plays a game of chess against a computer. Built using **Java**, **HTTP Websocket**, and **mySQL**. 

#### Activities created through my job
Experience creating accessible, interactive e-learning activities using **SmartBuilder**. Developed skills in **visual design**, **user interaction logic**, and **accessibility**. Developed projects in a process that included prototype review, peer review, and final client review. Built projects that included local storage or xAPI for the backend for tracking learning progress and performance, and also with custom **JavaScript**. Here are some examples of projects that I have made:
- Battleship-like game (the user plays against a computer which uses math to determine it's next best move)
- Activities similar to PhET simulations
- Click and reveal activities
- Clue-like card game (the user plays against two CPUs)
- Oregon Trail
