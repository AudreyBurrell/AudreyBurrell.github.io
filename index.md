# Hi, I'm Audrey

I am studying Computer Science with an emphasis in Human-Computer Interaction at BYU, and I am planning on graduating April 2028. I love UX/UI Design, coding, and creating interactive projects.

### Projects
[DoodleDrop](https://github.com/AudreyBurrell/doodledrop)
DoodleDrop is a web app where users can draw on a digital canvas and save them to their 'gallery'. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript (React)**, **Node.js**, and  **MongoDB**. Includes user authentication, gallery management, and an interactive design. Built while taking CS 260 in January - April 2025. 

[StudyingGame](https://github.com/AudreyBurrell/StudyingGame)
StudyingGame (name will be changed later) is a mash between Quizlet and Blooket, keeping the best parts of each and (hopefully) getting rid of the parts that make it hard to use those applications. Build with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**. Users can either manually type in questions and their answers (can export it to a CSV later) or they can import a CSV. Afterwards, they can do activities such as flashcards and taking a test, along with games like a boss battle (users answer questions to defeat a boss), tower builder (for every question the user gets right, they can place a piece of a tower, the game ends when the tower gets to the top of the screen or another predetermined point), and a mario-like platformer game (the user answers questions to get energy, tries to make it to the end). Eventually I want to add a feature where the user can save their sets (that was imported through CSV or manually typed in).
