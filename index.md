I am studying Computer Science with an emphasis in Human-Computer Interaction at BYU, and I am planning on graduating April 2028. I love UX/UI Design, coding, and creating interactive projects.

### 💻 Projects
#### [DoodleDrop](https://github.com/AudreyBurrell/doodledrop)
DoodleDrop is a web app where users can draw on a digital canvas and save them to their 'gallery'. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript (React)**, **Node.js**, and  **MongoDB**. Includes user authentication, gallery management, and an interactive design. Developed as part of _CS 260 (Web Programming)_ at BYU, January-April 2025.

#### [StudyingGame](https://github.com/AudreyBurrell/StudyingGame)
StudyingGame (name will be changed later) is a mash between Quizlet and Blooket, keeping the best parts of each and (hopefully) getting rid of the parts that make it hard to use those applications. Build with **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**. Users can manually create or import question sets (via CSV) and practice using flashcards, tests, and games like a boss battle (defeat a boss by answering questions), tower builder (stack pieces for every correct answer) and a mario-like platformer game (answer questions to get energy). At the end of the games, it will display the percentage of questions they got right and if they got any question wrong more than once, it will display those questions and offer a personalized flashcard activity with just those questions. Planned features include saving user sets for later review.

#### Activities created through my job
Experience creating accessible, interactive e-learning activities using **SmartBuilder**. Developed skills in **visual design**, **user interaction logic**, and **accessibility**. Developed projects in a process that included prototype review, peer review, and final client review. Built projects that included local storage or xAPI for the backend for tracking learning progress and performance.
